# Communicate Data Findings


### Project Overview <a name="project_overview"></a>

This project has two parts that demonstrate the importance and value of data visualization techniques in the data analysis process.

In Part I, Exploratory data visualization, I used Python visualization libraries to systematically explore a selected dataset, starting from plots of single variables and building up to plots of multiple variables.

In Part II, Explanatory data visualization, I produced a short presentation that illustrates interesting properties, trends, and relationships that I discovered in the dataset. 

### Tools Used
This project uses Python 3 and is designed to be completed through the Jupyter Notebooks IDE. The following libraries are expected to be used in this project:
NumPy
pandas
Matplotlib
Seaborn

### Ford GoBike System Dataset
 This data set includes information about individual rides made in a bike-sharing system covering the greater San Francisco Bay area.
